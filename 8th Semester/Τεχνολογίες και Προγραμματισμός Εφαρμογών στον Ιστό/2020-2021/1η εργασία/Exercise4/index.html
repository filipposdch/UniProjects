                    <p>In this article we are going to take a look at the cyber attack that hit SolarWinds and
                        every major corporation, organisation and government agency that it affected.<br>
                        The attack became known at 13th of December, 2020, although it has been latent and active for
                        months
                        before that date.<br>
                        The attackers exploited a vulnerability in one of SolarWind's system in order to isnert their
                        own
                        malicious code.<br>
                        The same code was rolled out as part of routine software updates the company sent to its
                        clients,
                        which in turn made each and every one of them vulnerable to the same exploit.<br>
                        The impact of the attack was not only financial, as major concerns were raised as to which
                        systems
                        have been compromised and what kind of data was leaked.<br>

                    <p><dfn>SolarWinds</dfn> is the name of a major IT software company.<br>
                        They provide softare for Network, System as well as Database Management, being more well-known
                        for
                        the former of the three.<br>
                        The company was founded in 1999 by the brothers Donald and David Yonce. Its customer base
                        includes
                        many U.S. agencies as well more than 400 companies in the Fortune 500 list. The most famous of
                        SolarWinds' products is Orion.<br>

                            hearing about
                            SolarWinds. But I guarantee your IT department will know about it.</p>

                    <p>A <dfn>supply chain attack</dfn> aims to gain access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability in
                        third-party
                        software that the system uses.<br>
                        Every system is a collection of communicating sub-systems. By finding a weak link in this chain
                        of
                        dependencies an attacker can potentially infiltrate all other systems that depend on it. <br>
