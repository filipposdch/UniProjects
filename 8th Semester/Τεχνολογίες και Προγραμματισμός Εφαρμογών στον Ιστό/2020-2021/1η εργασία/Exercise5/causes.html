            <h3>Orion Vulnerabilities & SUNBURST</h3>
            <p>The attack named <cite><a
                        href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"
                        target="_blank">SUNBURST</a></cite>
                began around March, 2020 and it went undetected for nearly nine months.
                SUBURST takes advantage of the supply chain attack concept to infiltrate a system via SolarWind's
                Orion IT Management software.<br>
                The actors behind the attack managed to "hijack" Orion updates by introducing a malicious dll
                library file in the update itself which was then rolled out to clients of the software.<br>
                What made the attack go unoticed for so long was the fact that the package containing the trojan was
                digitally signed by SolarWinds, therefore attesting to its authenticity. Another tactic used to avoid
                detection was a controlled shutdown each time the exploit found out a specific threat-detection
                process was running on the background. The trojan constantly scanned the host machine to determine not
                only when those
                intrusion detection and prevention processes were running but also where the machine was located, who
                the user was and whether or not the
                infected machine was part of a specific subnet<br>

            <h3>Mitigation measures</h3>
            <p>In order to mitigate the effects of the SolarWinds attack, the American <a
                    href="https://www.cisa.gov">CISA</a>
                issued an emergency warning recommending the following security measures to be taken:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="scrumb">Install all the latest security updates provided by SolarWinds for all the systems
                    affected.</li>
                <li class="scrumb">Run programs without administrator priviledges.</li>
                <li class="scrumb">Limit web traffic to trusted websites only.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Futhermore, the company Fireeye, which provides cyber-security solutions, advised all potential users to
                block all inbound and outbound traffic to SolarWinds servers, to change user account passwords and
                thoroughly review network devices' configuration. <br>
                It was also advised that affected SolarWinds software be uninstalled altogether and re-installed again
                to
                further reduce the risk of traces of the malware being left behind. However this in many cases wasn't
                possible as
                it was very difficult for large companies to all identify the products that needed to be removed. In
                addition said software was impossible to be uninstalled immediately as it was crucial to the operation
                of the
                company. Mind you, Orion is SolarWinds most widely used Network Management software and many of these
                companies
                couldn't stay without it even for a short period of time. <br>
