                <p>The attack had a big and long lasting financial impact on the company. It's easy to see how the
                    outbreak of the news about the attack affected the price of SolarWind's stock (SWI). According
                    to stock market
                    watch websites such as <cite><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com">www.marketwatch.com</a></cite> on
                    December 13 2020,
                    the exact date when
                    <cite><a
                            href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-amazon-com-exclsuive-idUSKBN28N0PG">Reuters</a></cite>
                    disclosed the nature of the attack,
                    the SWI stock began to plummet as it dropped nearly 23% in one week. Since then the stock has
                    slowly risen in price, although the effects
                    of this disclosure can still be seen today as it has lost a lot of its former value. One of the
                    many reasons why this is could be because the attack
                    shook the shareholders' and the clients' faith in the company which made many of them withdraw
                    their funds and uninstall their software respectably.

                <p>It's not a surprise that this particular cyberattack has shaken the US to its core. A global
                    super-power such as the USA has been enduring such attacks
                    for years be it from the inside, or from its competitors, particularly China and Russia. But why
                    is <em>this</em> attack any different?<br>
                    First of all, Orion and similar affected products were installed in many U.S. agencies including
                    the U.S. military, the State Department,
                    the National Security Agency, and the Office of President of the United States. We can therefore
                    estimate what kind of information could have been leaked
                    and how it was going to be used in the worst case senario. The fact that the attack was
                    discovered right before the elections for the US presidency also raised
                    major concern over whether private data about the candidates was stolen and how this could
                    affect the outcome. U.S. officials have asserted that the attack
                    was conducted by Russian hackers in favour of the Russian government, something that would
                    classify it as "cyber-espionage". Former US President Donald J. Trump tweeted:<br> </p>
