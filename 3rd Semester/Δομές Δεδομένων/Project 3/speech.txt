Frodo: you're late.
Gandalf: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early; he arrives precisely when he means to.
************************
Saruman: (in thought) Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom, the hour grows late, and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard, seeking my counsel. (to Gandalf) For that is why you have come, is it not? My old friend.
Gandalf: Saruman.
Saruman: You are sure of this?
Gandalf: Beyond any doubt.
